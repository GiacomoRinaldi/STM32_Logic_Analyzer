# STM32_Logic_Analyzer
Basic logic analyzer using an STM32F103C8T6 on a custom PCB 
Note to self: to program; set boot0 high and carefully flash using ST-Link, then set boot0 low to use
Tim2 clocking at 5.14 MHz, so rollover is rouhgly 1.74 minutes of sampling time on device
Project road map: 
- By July 20: have polling example setup with python code ready to roll (hopefully working)
    * polling STM project is set; just need to generate Python scripts and test out; interrupt finalized
- By July 27: integrate work onto Git; update resume and LinkedIn
- By August 5: be ready to apply to internships
- work on documentation tomorrow and damage control
